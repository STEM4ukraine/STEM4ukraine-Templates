These are devmaps for mapping the more complicated schematic symbols to PCB footprint terminals.

They can go into your  ~/.sch-rnd/devmap/  directory

The 3mmLEDbackplane-annotated.devmap maps the pins of the sch-rnd LED symbol to the custom backplane 3mm LED footprint used in pcb-rnd to achive a "through hole" LED body.
